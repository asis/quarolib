# QuaroLib

Some code that can be reused across many different projects. The aim is to not
create libraries that need to support all uses cases.

The base code is here, if something more specific needs to be built, then
modify the code. Nevertheless pull requests to fix bugs in the code are always
welcome.

### What is in there

##### Helper to create tooltips

`hooks/usePopper.js`: glue code between popper.js and React
`components/Tooltip.jsx`: the base styled components for building tooltips
